["# ESP32-WROOM-32 to MPU6050 Accelerometer Wiring Instructions\n\n1. Connect VCC on the accelerometer to the 3.3V pin on the ESP32.\n2. Connect GND on the accelerometer to any GND pin on the ESP32.\n3. Connect SDA on the accelerometer to GPIO 21 (already assigned) on the ESP32.\n4. Connect SCL on the accelerometer to GPIO 22 (already assigned) on the ESP32.\n\n**Note:** The MPU6050 typically operates at 3.3V logic level, which matches the ESP32's operating voltage, making it compatible without level shifters. The default I2C address of 0x68 (104 decimal) will be used as specified in the device properties."]
