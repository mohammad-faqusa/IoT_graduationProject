["# Instructions for Wiring MPU6050 Accelerometer to ESP32-WROOM-32\n\n1. Connect VCC of the accelerometer to the 3.3V power pin on the ESP32.\n2. Connect GND of the accelerometer to any GND pin on the ESP32.\n3. Connect SDA to GPIO 21 on the ESP32 (as already assigned).\n4. Connect SCL to GPIO 22 on the ESP32 (as already assigned).\n\n**Notes:**\n- The MPU6050 accelerometer uses I2C communication protocol with the default I2C address of 0x68 (104 decimal).\n- The sensor provides both accelerometer (measuring acceleration in g) and gyroscope (measuring rotation in degrees per second) functionality.\n- The device has simulation mode enabled by default, which will return random values for testing. To use actual sensor data, set the \"simulate\" parameter to false when initializing.","# Wiring Instructions for Internal LED on ESP32-WROOM-32\n\n1. No external wiring is required for the internal LED.\n\n2. The internal LED is already connected to GPIO 2 on the ESP32-WROOM-32 board.\n\n3. This is an onboard LED that comes pre-wired on the ESP32 development board.\n\n4. The LED is typically connected in an active-high configuration, meaning it turns on when GPIO 2 is set to HIGH.\n\n5. In your code, you'll simply need to initialize the internal LED with pin 2 to control it.\n\nNote: The internal LED is a convenient indicator for testing and debugging purposes without requiring any additional components or wiring."]
