["# Wiring Instructions: Connecting MPU6050 Accelerometer to ESP32-WROOM-32\n\n1. Connect VCC on the MPU6050 accelerometer to the 3.3V output pin of the ESP32.\n2. Connect GND on the MPU6050 accelerometer to any GND pin on the ESP32.\n3. Connect SDA on the MPU6050 accelerometer to GPIO 21 on the ESP32 (already assigned).\n4. Connect SCL on the MPU6050 accelerometer to GPIO 22 on the ESP32 (already assigned).\n\nNote: These are all the required connections for the MPU6050 accelerometer. The device uses the I2C protocol for communication, which only requires the SDA (data) and SCL (clock) lines, plus power (VCC and GND). Some MPU6050 modules may have additional pins like INT (interrupt) or AD0 (address select), but these are not required for basic operation and can remain unconnected.","# Wiring Instructions for ESP32-WROOM-32 Internal LED\n\n1. No physical wiring is required for the internal LED on the ESP32-WROOM-32 board.\n\n2. The internal LED is already connected to GPIO 2 as part of the ESP32 board design.\n\n3. This is a built-in LED that comes pre-wired on most ESP32 development boards.\n\n4. The LED is typically active-high, meaning it will turn on when GPIO 2 is set to HIGH.\n\n5. No external components or connections are needed to use this feature.\n\n6. You can begin using the internal LED immediately in your code by initializing it with GPIO pin 2.\n\nNote: If your specific ESP32 board variant doesn't have an internal LED on GPIO 2, refer to your board's documentation to identify the correct GPIO pin for the onboard LED.","# Instructions for Wiring Motion Sensor to ESP32-WROOM-32\n\n1. Connect VCC of the motion sensor to the 5V output pin of the ESP32 (most PIR sensors operate best at 5V, but check your specific sensor's datasheet).\n\n2. Connect GND of the motion sensor to any GND pin on the ESP32.\n\n3. Connect the output pin (PIRQ) of the motion sensor to GPIO 5 on the ESP32 (as already specified in your configuration).\n\n4. Ensure the motion sensor is placed in a suitable location with an unobstructed view of the area you want to monitor.\n\n5. Some PIR sensors have a sensitivity adjustment potentiometer - adjust this as needed after installation if your sensor includes this feature.\n\n6. Some PIR sensors also have a time delay adjustment potentiometer - this controls how long the output remains high after motion is detected. Adjust as needed if your sensor includes this feature.\n\nNote: PIR sensors typically need a warm-up period of 30-60 seconds after power is applied before they provide reliable readings. Consider this in your code implementation.","# Servo Motor Wiring Instructions for ESP32-WROOM-32\n\n1. Connect the **servo motor's GND wire** (typically black or brown) to any **GND pin** on the ESP32.\n\n2. Connect the **servo motor's VCC wire** (typically red) to the **5V output** of the ESP32. (Note: Most servo motors require 5V for proper operation. If using a micro servo specifically rated for 3.3V, you can connect to the 3.3V pin instead)\n\n3. Connect the **servo motor's signal wire** (typically yellow, orange, or white) to **GPIO 13** on the ESP32, as already assigned.\n\n4. Make sure the connections are secure and that no wires are crossed or shorting.\n\n5. If using a larger or high-torque servo that draws significant current, consider using an external power supply for the servo's VCC connection, while keeping the GND connected to both the ESP32 and the external power supply.\n\n6. For stable operation, you may want to add a small capacitor (100-220μF) between the servo's VCC and GND connections to help smooth power delivery during servo movement.","# DHT Sensor Wiring Instructions for ESP32-WROOM-32\n\n1. Connect the DHT sensor's data pin to GPIO 4 on the ESP32 (already assigned).\n2. Connect the DHT sensor's VCC pin to the 3.3V output on the ESP32.\n3. Connect the DHT sensor's GND pin to any GND pin on the ESP32.\n\n## Additional Notes:\n- The DHT sensor requires only three connections: data, power, and ground.\n- Make sure to place a 10kΩ pull-up resistor between the data pin (GPIO 4) and VCC if your DHT sensor module doesn't have one built-in.\n- Keep the wire length between the ESP32 and DHT sensor as short as possible to avoid signal degradation.\n- The DHT22 (AM2302) offers better accuracy and range than the DHT11, but both are compatible with this wiring setup.\n- When using the sensor in non-simulation mode, ensure readings are taken no more frequently than once every 2 seconds to avoid sensor overheating or erratic readings."]
