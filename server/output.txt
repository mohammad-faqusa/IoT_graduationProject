["# Wiring Instructions for MPU6050 Accelerometer to ESP32-WROOM-32\n\n1. Connect VCC pin of the accelerometer to the 3.3V output pin of the ESP32.\n2. Connect GND pin of the accelerometer to any GND pin on the ESP32.\n3. Connect SDA pin of the accelerometer to GPIO 21 on the ESP32 (already assigned).\n4. Connect SCL pin of the accelerometer to GPIO 22 on the ESP32 (already assigned).\n\n**Notes:**\n- The MPU6050 accelerometer operates at 3.3V which matches the ESP32's logic level.\n- This connection uses the I2C protocol with the default address of 0x68 (104 in decimal).\n- No additional pins are required for basic operation of the accelerometer.\n- Make sure your connections are secure and that there are no loose wires that could cause shorts."]
