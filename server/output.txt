["# Wiring Internal LED to ESP32-WROOM-32\n\n## Instructions:\n\n1. No external wiring is required for the internal LED.\n\n2. The internal LED is already built into your ESP32-WROOM-32 board and is connected to GPIO pin 2.\n\n3. This is the small LED that's typically located on the PCB of your ESP32 development board.\n\n4. The LED is typically active-high, meaning it turns ON when GPIO2 is set HIGH.\n\n5. In your code, you can control this LED using pin 2 which is already correctly defined in your configuration.\n\nNote: The internal LED is fully integrated into the board's circuitry - this is why it's called \"internal.\" You don't need to connect any external components to use it.","# Wiring Instructions for Servo Motor to ESP32-WROOM-32\n\n1. Connect the servo motor's signal (control) wire to GPIO 13 on the ESP32 (already assigned).\n\n2. Connect the servo motor's VCC (power) wire to the 5V output pin on the ESP32. Most standard servo motors require 5V for optimal performance. If using a micro servo that can operate at 3.3V, you can connect to the 3.3V pin instead.\n\n3. Connect the servo motor's GND (ground) wire to any GND pin on the ESP32.\n\n4. Important: If you're powering multiple servos or a larger servo that draws significant current, consider using an external power supply for the servo's VCC connection. In this case, remember to connect the ground of the external power supply to the ESP32's ground to ensure a common reference.\n\n5. Optional but recommended: Add a decoupling capacitor (100-470μF) between the servo's VCC and GND connections to help stabilize the power supply, especially if you notice erratic servo behavior.\n\nNote: Servo motors typically have three wires in a standardized color scheme - brown/black for GND, red for VCC, and orange/yellow/white for the signal wire.","# DHT Sensor Wiring Instructions for ESP32-WROOM-32\n\n## Materials Needed\n- ESP32-WROOM-32 board\n- DHT11 or DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor\n- Jumper wires\n- Optional: 10kΩ pull-up resistor for data line\n\n## Wiring Steps\n\n1. Connect the DHT sensor's VCC pin to the 3.3V output pin on the ESP32.\n\n2. Connect the DHT sensor's GND pin to any GND pin on the ESP32.\n\n3. Connect the DHT sensor's data pin to GPIO 4 on the ESP32 (as already specified in your configuration).\n\n4. Optional but recommended: Connect a 10kΩ pull-up resistor between the data pin (GPIO 4) and VCC (3.3V) to ensure reliable communication with the sensor.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- The DHT11 and DHT22 sensors are powered by 3.3V from the ESP32. Some DHT sensors can work with 5V, but 3.3V is safer and compatible with the ESP32's logic levels.\n\n- Your configuration has the \"simulate\" attribute set to true by default, which means the sensor will generate random temperature and humidity values. Set this to false in your code when you want to read actual sensor data.\n\n- DHT sensors require a \"settling time\" of about 1-2 seconds between readings. Keep this in mind when programming your measurement intervals.\n\n- The DHT22 (also known as AM2302) offers better accuracy and range compared to the DHT11, but either will work with this wiring configuration."]
