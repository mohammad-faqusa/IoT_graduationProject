["# Wiring Instructions for MPU6050 Accelerometer to ESP32-WROOM-32\n\n1. Connect VCC of the accelerometer to the 3.3V output pin of the ESP32.\n2. Connect GND of the accelerometer to any GND pin on the ESP32.\n3. Connect SDA of the accelerometer to GPIO 21 on the ESP32 (already assigned).\n4. Connect SCL of the accelerometer to GPIO 22 on the ESP32 (already assigned).\n5. The INT pin is optional - leave it unconnected unless you need the motion detection or data-ready interrupt functionality.\n6. If your accelerometer has an AD0 pin, connect it to GND to maintain the default I2C address of 0x68 (104 decimal) which is already configured in your settings.\n\nNote: The MPU6050 works best with 3.3V logic levels, which matches the ESP32's I/O voltage, making them directly compatible without level shifters."]
