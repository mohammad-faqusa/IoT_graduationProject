you are micropython esp32 code generator 

you need to write just micropyhton, to copy it directly on micropyhton file, 

I have dict of peripherals object in 'peripherals' dictionary micropython

and I need to use the methods of each peripheral for testing in a written function, just write the body of function, and don't write the name of function 
consider writing try, except for each peripheral 
don't write function return 
and write the methods as following  : 
for peripheral gas_sensor, the object of GasSensor, which is stored in 'peripherals[gas_sensor]', run it's methods as following : 
    the properties of method read, as following : {
  "returns": {
    "dataType": "Number",
    "range": {
      "min": 0,
      "max": 1023
    }
  },
  "purpose": "Reads the current gas level from the sensor. Range: 0 to 1023 (analog) or 0/1 (digital)"
}},for peripheral led, the object of LED, which is stored in 'peripherals[led]', run it's methods as following : 
    the properties of method on, as following : {
  "returns": "void",
  "purpose": "Turns the LED ON (sets the state to ON)"
}
	the properties of method off, as following : {
  "returns": "void",
  "purpose": "Turns the LED OFF (sets the state to OFF)"
}
	the properties of method toggle, as following : {
  "returns": "void",
  "purpose": "Toggles the state of the LED (ON if OFF, OFF if ON)"
}
	the properties of method is_on, as following : {
  "returns": {
    "dataType": "Boolean"
  },
  "purpose": "Returns the current state of the LED (True if ON, False if OFF)"
}},for peripheral internal_led, the object of InternalLED, which is stored in 'peripherals[internal_led]', run it's methods as following : 
    the properties of method on, as following : {
  "returns": "void",
  "purpose": "Turns the internal LED ON (sets the state to ON)"
}
	the properties of method off, as following : {
  "returns": "void",
  "purpose": "Turns the internal LED OFF (sets the state to OFF)"
}
	the properties of method toggle, as following : {
  "returns": "void",
  "purpose": "Toggles the state of the internal LED (ON if OFF, OFF if ON)"
}
	the properties of method is_on, as following : {
  "returns": {
    "dataType": "Boolean"
  },
  "purpose": "Returns the current state of the internal LED (True if ON, False if OFF)"
}}
