# Using OpenAI API with MicroPython on ESP32

I'd be happy to help you with using the OpenAI API for MicroPython ESP32 code generation. Here's how you can set this up:

## Basic Approach

To use the OpenAI API with MicroPython on an ESP32, you'll need to:

1. Connect your ESP32 to WiFi
2. Make HTTP requests to the OpenAI API
3. Parse the JSON responses
4. Handle the returned code appropriately

## Example Code

Here's a basic implementation for ESP32 MicroPython:

```python
import network
import urequests
import json
import time

# WiFi credentials
SSID = "your_wifi_ssid"
PASSWORD = "your_wifi_password"

# OpenAI API details
API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"
API_URL = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"

def connect_wifi():
    """Connect to WiFi network"""
    wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
    wlan.active(True)
    if not wlan.isconnected():
        print('Connecting to WiFi...')
        wlan.connect(SSID, PASSWORD)
        # Wait for connection with timeout
        max_wait = 10
        while max_wait > 0:
            if wlan.isconnected():
                break
            max_wait -= 1
            print('Waiting for connection...')
            time.sleep(1)
    
    if wlan.isconnected():
        print('Connected to WiFi')
        print('Network config:', wlan.ifconfig())
        return True
    else:
        print('Failed to connect to WiFi')
        return False

def generate_code(prompt):
    """Generate code using OpenAI API"""
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    
    data = {
        "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        "messages": [
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that generates MicroPython code for ESP32."},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ],
        "temperature": 0.7
    }
    
    try:
        response = urequests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))
        if response.status_code == 200:
            response_data = response.json()
            code = response_data['choices'][0]['message']['content']
            return code
        else:
            print(f"API Error: {response.status_code}")
            print(response.text)
            return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Request failed: {e}")
        return None
    finally:
        if 'response' in locals():
            response.close()

# Main execution
if connect_wifi():
    prompt = "Write a MicroPython function to blink an LED connected to pin 2 on ESP32"
    result = generate_code(prompt)
    if result:
        print("\nGenerated Code:")
        print(result)
        
        # Optionally execute the generated code
        # Be careful with this - only execute code you trust
        # exec(result)
```

## Memory Considerations

ESP32 has limited memory. For complex prompts or responses, you may need to:
- Use chunked requests/responses
- Simplify your prompts
- Handle memory errors gracefully

## Security Notes

1. Never hardcode your API key in production code
2. Be cautious about executing generated code directly
3. Consider storing credentials in a separate config file or using environment variables

## Improved Implementation

For a more robust implementation, you might want to add:
- Error handling and retries
- Configuration file for credentials
- Rate limiting to respect API quotas
- Memory management techniques

Would you like me to expand on any specific part of this implementation?
