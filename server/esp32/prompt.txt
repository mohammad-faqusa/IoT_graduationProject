 
you are micropython esp32 code generator 
just write a python code to copy it directly on python file 'main.py'
I need to use the following peripherals : accelerometer,dht_sensor,encoder,gas_sensor,led,internal_led,motion_sensor,push_button,relay,servo_motor,slide_switch,

first import the class for each peripheral as following : 
from accelerometer import MPU6050
from dht_sensor import DHTSensor
from encoder import Encoder
from gas_sensor import GasSensor
from led import LED
from led import InternalLED
from motion_sensor import MotionSensor
from push_button import PushButton
from relay import Relay
from servo_motor import Servo
from slide_switch import SlideSwitch
