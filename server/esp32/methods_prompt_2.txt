you are micropython esp32 code generator 

you need to write just micropyhton, to copy it directly on micropyhton file, 

I have dict of peripherals object in 'peripherals' dictionary micropython

and I need to use the methods of each peripheral for testing in a written function, just write the body of function, and don't write the name of function 
consider writing try, except for each peripheral 
don't write function return 
and write the methods as following  : 
for peripheral motion_sensor, the object of MotionSensor, which is stored in 'peripherals[motion_sensor]', run it's methods as following : 
    the properties of method read, as following : {
  "returns": {
    "dataType": "Boolean",
    "values_meaning": {
      "true": "Motion detected",
      "false": "No motion detected"
    }
  },
  "purpose": "Reads the current state of the motion sensor"
}
	the properties of method wait_for_motion, as following : {
  "returns": {
    "dataType": "Boolean",
    "values_meaning": {
      "true": "Motion detected within timeout",
      "false": "No motion detected within timeout"
    }
  },
  "parameters": {
    "timeout": {
      "dataType": "Number",
      "default": 10,
      "unit": "seconds",
      "purpose": "Timeout duration to wait for motion detection"
    }
  },
  "purpose": "Waits for motion detection for a specified timeout period"
}},for peripheral push_button, the object of PushButton, which is stored in 'peripherals[push_button]', run it's methods as following : 
    the properties of method set_simulated_state, as following : {
  "parameters": {
    "pressed": {
      "dataType": "Boolean",
      "values_meaning": {
        "true": "Simulates button pressed",
        "false": "Simulates button released"
      },
      "purpose": "Sets the simulated state of the button (only used in simulation mode)"
    }
  },
  "returns": "void",
  "purpose": "Sets the simulated button state"
}
	the properties of method is_pressed, as following : {
  "returns": {
    "dataType": "Boolean",
    "values_meaning": {
      "true": "Button is pressed",
      "false": "Button is released"
    }
  },
  "purpose": "Checks if the button is pressed or released, applies debounce logic"
}
	the properties of method push, as following : {
  "returns": "void",
  "purpose": "Simulates a button press and release cycle (only for simulation mode)"
}
	the properties of method get_event, as following : {
  "returns": {
    "dataType": "Boolean",
    "values_meaning": {
      "true": "Button was pressed",
      "false": "No button press detected"
    }
  },
  "purpose": "Returns and clears the `was_pressed` flag indicating whether the button was pressed"
}},for peripheral relay, the object of Relay, which is stored in 'peripherals[relay]', run it's methods as following : 
    the properties of method on, as following : {
  "returns": "void",
  "purpose": "Turns the relay ON (sets pin to HIGH or LOW based on active_high)"
}
	the properties of method off, as following : {
  "returns": "void",
  "purpose": "Turns the relay OFF (sets pin to LOW or HIGH based on active_high)"
}
	the properties of method toggle, as following : {
  "returns": "void",
  "purpose": "Toggles the relay state between ON and OFF"
}
	the properties of method is_on, as following : {
  "returns": {
    "dataType": "Boolean"
  },
  "purpose": "Returns the current state of the relay (True if ON, False if OFF)"
}}
