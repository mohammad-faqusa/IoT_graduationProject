you are micropython esp32 code generator 

you need to write just micropyhton, to copy it directly on micropyhton file, 

I have dict of peripherals object in 'peripherals' dictionary micropython

and I need to use the methods of each peripheral for testing in a written function, just write the body of function, and don't write the name of function 
consider writing try, except for each peripheral 
don't write function return 
and write the methods as following  : 
for peripheral servo_motor, the object of Servo, which is stored in 'peripherals[servo_motor]', run it's methods as following : 
    the properties of method write_angle, as following : {
  "returns": "void",
  "parameters": {
    "angle": {
      "dataType": "Number",
      "range": {
        "min": 0,
        "max": 180
      },
      "unit": "°",
      "purpose": "Sets the servo motor to a specific angle, from 0° to 180°"
    }
  },
  "purpose": "Sets the servo motor's angle by calculating the corresponding pulse width"
}
	the properties of method write_us, as following : {
  "returns": "void",
  "parameters": {
    "us": {
      "dataType": "Number",
      "range": {
        "min": 500,
        "max": 2500
      },
      "unit": "μs",
      "purpose": "Sets the servo motor's pulse width directly in microseconds"
    }
  },
  "purpose": "Sets the servo motor's pulse width directly in microseconds and updates the angle"
}
	the properties of method get_state, as following : {
  "returns": {
    "dataType": "Object",
    "properties": {
      "pin": {
        "dataType": "Number",
        "purpose": "GPIO pin the servo is connected to"
      },
      "angle": {
        "dataType": "Number",
        "unit": "°",
        "purpose": "Current angle of the servo motor"
      },
      "pulse_us": {
        "dataType": "Number",
        "unit": "μs",
        "purpose": "Current pulse width of the servo motor"
      }
    }
  },
  "purpose": "Returns the current state of the servo motor including pin, angle, and pulse width"
}
	the properties of method deinit, as following : {
  "returns": "void",
  "purpose": "Deinitializes the servo motor and releases resources"
}},for peripheral slide_switch, the object of SlideSwitch, which is stored in 'peripherals[slide_switch]', run it's methods as following : 
    the properties of method set_simulated_state, as following : {
  "parameters": {
    "state": {
      "dataType": "Boolean",
      "values_meaning": {
        "true": "Simulates turning the switch ON",
        "false": "Simulates turning the switch OFF"
      }
    }
  },
  "returns": "void",
  "purpose": "Sets the internal state of the switch during simulation"
}
	the properties of method read, as following : {
  "returns": {
    "dataType": "Boolean",
    "values_meaning": {
      "true": "Switch is ON",
      "false": "Switch is OFF"
    }
  },
  "purpose": "Reads the current switch state (either simulated or from the actual pin)"
}
	the properties of method state, as following : {
  "returns": {
    "dataType": "Boolean",
    "values_meaning": {
      "true": "Switch is ON",
      "false": "Switch is OFF"
    }
  },
  "purpose": "Property alias for reading the switch state"
}}
