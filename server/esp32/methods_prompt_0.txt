you are micropython esp32 code generator 

you need to write just micropyhton, to copy it directly on micropyhton file, 

I have dict of peripherals object in 'peripherals' dictionary micropython

and I need to use the methods of each peripheral for testing in a written function, just write the body of function, and don't write the name of function 
consider writing try, except for each peripheral 
don't write function return 
and write the methods as following  : 
for peripheral accelerometer, the object of MPU6050, which is stored in 'peripherals[accelerometer]', run it's methods as following : 
    the properties of method read_accel, as following : {
  "returns": {
    "dataType": "Array",
    "elementType": "Number",
    "length": 3,
    "unit": "g"
  },
  "purpose": "Returns a tuple of X, Y, Z acceleration values"
}
	the properties of method read_gyro, as following : {
  "returns": {
    "dataType": "Array",
    "elementType": "Number",
    "length": 3,
    "unit": "deg/s"
  },
  "purpose": "Returns a tuple of X, Y, Z gyroscope values"
}
	the properties of method read_all, as following : {
  "returns": {
    "dataType": "Object",
    "properties": {
      "accel": {
        "dataType": "Array",
        "elementType": "Number",
        "length": 3,
        "unit": "g"
      },
      "gyro": {
        "dataType": "Array",
        "elementType": "Number",
        "length": 3,
        "unit": "deg/s"
      }
    }
  },
  "purpose": "Returns both accelerometer and gyroscope readings in one call"
}},for peripheral dht_sensor, the object of DHTSensor, which is stored in 'peripherals[dht_sensor]', run it's methods as following : 
    the properties of method measure, as following : {
  "returns": "void",
  "purpose": "Triggers the sensor to update temperature and humidity readings"
}
	the properties of method temperature, as following : {
  "returns": {
    "dataType": "Number",
    "unit": "°C",
    "range": {
      "min": -40,
      "max": 125
    }
  },
  "purpose": "Returns the last measured temperature value. Range: -40°C to 125°C"
}
	the properties of method humidity, as following : {
  "returns": {
    "dataType": "Number",
    "unit": "%",
    "range": {
      "min": 0,
      "max": 100
    }
  },
  "purpose": "Returns the last measured humidity value. Range: 0% to 100%"
}},for peripheral encoder, the object of Encoder, which is stored in 'peripherals[encoder]', run it's methods as following : 
    the properties of method get_position, as following : {
  "returns": {
    "dataType": "Number",
    "purpose": "Returns the current position of the encoder"
  }
}
	the properties of method reset, as following : {
  "returns": "void",
  "purpose": "Resets the encoder position back to zero"
}
	the properties of method simulate_step, as following : {
  "parameters": {
    "steps": {
      "dataType": "Number",
      "purpose": "Number of steps to increment or decrement position (for simulate mode)"
    }
  },
  "returns": "void",
  "purpose": "Manually updates the encoder position during simulation mode",
  "availability": "Only available when simulate=true"
}}
