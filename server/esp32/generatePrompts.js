  initialize the 'peripherals_pins' dict, that take the peripheral name as key, and it's connected pins as dict value, it will be used later to know pin connection.
  then initialize each peripheral class as following, and store it in peripherals dict 'peripherals' : 

  ${peripherals_info

        `the class name for peripheral ${p.name} is ${

        }(parameters...), consider the default values of parameters. 
        then insert the connected pins to 'peripherals_pins[${p.name}]'

You are working with an **ESP32-WROOM-32** microcontroller and the following peripheral device: **"${deviceName}"**

Partial pin connections for the device:
\`\`\`json
${prettyJSON({ [deviceName]: pinsConnection })}
\`\`\`

All known pin properties of the device:
\`\`\`json
${prettyJSON(pinProperties)}
\`\`\`

ðŸ”§ Your task:
Generate a complete list of step-by-step instructions for wiring the **"${deviceName}"** to an ESP32-WROOM-32 board.

ðŸ“Œ Rules & Tips:
- **Preserve** all existing connections.
- Use valid GPIO pins on the ESP32 (0â€“39). Avoid GPIOs 6â€“11 (used for flash) and GPIOs 34â€“39 (input-only).
- Assign safe and common GPIO defaults to unassigned required pins.
- Power pins (like VCC) should be connected to 3.3V unless specified otherwise.
- Optional pins can be connected if helpful, or left unconnected with a brief explanation.
- Do not include any JSON â€” just plain-text steps.

âœ… Output format (example):
1. Connect VCC to 3.3V output of ESP32.
2. Connect GND to GND pin on ESP32.
3. Connect SDA to GPIO 21 (already assigned).
4. Connect SCL to GPIO 22 (already assigned).
5. Leave INT unconnected unless motion detection interrupt is needed.
6. Pull AD0 to GND to select I2C address 0x68.

Provide the steps in plain text format only.
